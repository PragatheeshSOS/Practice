# Smallest Number In Number String By Removing K Times...............................................................................
'''
Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove any k (need not be consecutive numbers) digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:
Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:
Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left
For example:
Input	Result
10200
1
200
8577
2
57
